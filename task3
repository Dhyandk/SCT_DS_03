"""🔍 Insights**
---
The Decision Tree Classifier was used to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on demographic and behavioral features from the Bank Marketing dataset.

Top features influencing the decision (based on feature importance analysis):
--
duration: Duration of the last contact call.
poutcome: Outcome of the previous marketing campaign.
previous: Number of contacts performed before this campaign.
campaign: Number of contacts during the current campaign.
balance: Customer's average yearly account balance.
Limiting the visualization to the top 3 levels of the tree made it easier to interpret and revealed key decision rules based on duration and poutcome.

The Model achieved an accuracy score of 89%
--
Model Interpretability is a major advantage of Decision Trees, making them suitable for understanding customer behavior.

To improve the model and reduce overfitting:
--
Limit tree depth (max_depth)
Use Cost-Complexity Pruning (ccp_alpha)
Try ensemble methods like Random Forests or Gradient Boosted Trees
This model can serve as a baseline for more advanced customer targeting strategies in marketing campaigns.
